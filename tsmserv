Subject: Farewell and Thank You

Hello everyone,

As my journey here comes to an end, I wanted to take a moment to say goodbye and thank you all.

It has been a true pleasure working alongside you these past few years. I’m grateful for the opportunities, the learning experiences, and above all, the people I’ve had the chance to collaborate with. I’ll carry with me many great memories of our time together.

Though I’m heading off to explore a new professional chapter, I sincerely hope our paths will cross again in the future. Please don’t hesitate to reach out — I’d be happy to stay in touch.

Wishing you all continued success, both professionally and personally.
